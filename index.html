                <div class="front-blurb">
					<p align="justify">
						I am interested in applied geospatial science, especially how remote sensing technology can be used to further our understanding of natural hazards and natural resources. Additionally, I am the founder of the Rhode Island Stone Wall Mapping Project. I have extensive experience in geospatial analysis and data collection, and am particularly experienced in working with LiDAR and multispectral data.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						I received my Bachelor of Science in Biological Sciences in 2018 from the University of Rhode Island (URI). After graduating with my Master's degree from URI in 2024, I worked on grant-funded projects in natural resources mapping and environmental analysis in the lab of Dr. Jason Parent. I also began working with small clients as an independent consultant. Later that year I was hired as a Research Associate at URI, where I worked on projects funded by the National Park Service (USA), among others.

						Most recently, I was accepted into the Geography (PhD) program at McGill University in Montr√©al, Canada, to work in the Applied Remote Sensing Lab. In this position I will be researching the remote sensing of wildfires under Dr. Margaret Kalacska.
