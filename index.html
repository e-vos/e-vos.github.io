						<br>I am interested in applied geospatial science, especially how remote sensing technology can be applied to furthering our understanding of natural hazards and natural resources. Additionally, I am the founder of the Rhode Island Stone Wall Mapping Project. I have extensive experience in geospatial analysis and data collection, and am particularly experienced in working with LiDAR and multispectral data.

						After graduating with my Master's degree in 2024, I worked on grant-funded projects in natural resources mapping and environmental analysis in the lab of Dr. Jason Parent. I also began working with small clients as an independent consultant. Later that year I was hired as a Research Associate at the University of Rhode Island, where I worked on projects funded by the National Park Service (USA), among others.
					</p>
					<p align="justify">
						Most recently, I was accepted into the Geography (PhD) program at McGill University in Montréal, Canada, to work in the Applied Remote Sensing Lab. In this position I will be researching the remote sensing of wildfires under Dr. Margaret Kalacska.
