						<br>Simmons Mill Pond Management Area is located in Little Compton, Rhode Island. Through my stone wall project connections, I was fortunate to network with my first consulting clients who own property abutting this management area. They were interested in showcasing the natural and cultural resources of the two properties, the overall goal being to highlight their shared history. This was one of my favorite projects, and I often reflect on my time spent working there.

						Working closely with the clients, I photographed sites and collected geospatial data. On the desktop side, I analyzed LiDAR data, incorporated my own <a href="/projects/riswmp/">Rhode Island Stone Wall Mapping Project</a> data, and studied historical aerial imagery to understand the area's present condition and how the landscape had changed over time.
